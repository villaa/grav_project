Based on Casertano model of the halo, halo density should be dropping with r and z, but not going to zero except at infinite z or r
- This was brought up as a concern at a meeting
    - rho does not go to zero, or at least shouldn't based on how it's written, but gets close for very large r (compared to rc)
    - gets very small for larger r; this explains asymptotic behavior
