We used the same units as this paper, so no unit conversions will be necessary
- Even our universal constants are done in these units, so any calculations will give us unit-appropriate values.

**Ups_b:**
- M/L Ratio of the bulge.
- This is called "ups" in the library
- Not fitting for this value.

**Ups_d**
- M/L Ratio of the disk.
- notes/JB/Writeup_Notes.ipynb gives a direct relationship between this and the prefactor.
    - linear relationship; just multiply both sides by the demoninator

**R_c:**
- We are fitting for this directly; no conversions necessary
- Halo parameter
- 'rc'

**rho_0**
- Is this supposed to be rho_00?
- can't find any explicit mention of rho_0 or rho_00 in the Nordermeer paper
- We are fitting for this directly, assuming it is rho_00; no conversions necessary
- Check again later to see if I can find anything on this.
