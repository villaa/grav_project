In Table 1, which provides his results, the luminosities in the mass-to-light ratios provided have a subscript $R$ which seems to reinforce this idea that the luminosity is not bolometric, but strictly in the R-band. Therefore, we use the R-band magnitude rather than adjusting to get a bolometric magnitude.\n",

    "The following equation comes from some [lecture notes from University of Texas](https://www.as.utexas.edu/astronomy/education/fall15/wheeler/secure/MagnitudeTutorial.pdf) and agrees with [University of Tennessee's website](http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/OJTA2dev/ojta/c2c/ordinary_stars/magnitudes/absolute_tl.html) (warning: popups :/). This equation is different from the one we found on [Wikipedia's entry on Luminosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity#In_astronomy), but that equation doesn't have a source, so the \"zero-point luminosity\" could have been miscalculated.  \n",
