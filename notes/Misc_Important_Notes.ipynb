    "\"...many combinations of parameters produce acceptable fits. In particular, it has been known for a long time that there exists a strong coupling between the contributions of the stellar disks and the dark matter haloes, in the sense that one can be scaled down while increasing the contribution from the other without degrading the quality of the fit (van Albada et al. 1985).\"\n",

    "\"First, we fitted equation 6.3 to the observed rotation curves, __leaving the bulge and disk mass-to-light ratios and the halo parameters free. If needed, a central point mass was included as well__, fitting its mass at the same time.\n",
    "These fits were done by minimising the chi-squared $\\chi_{1}^{2}$ between the model and the observed\n",
    "rotation curves, which is defined as: <br>\n",
    "    \\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\chi_{1}^{2} = \\sum_{j=1}^{N_p} \\left[\\frac{V_{mod,j} - V_{obs,j}}{\\sqrt{\\Delta V_{r,j}^{2} + \\Delta V_{i,j}^{2}}}\\right]^{2} \n",
    "    \\end{equation}<br>\n",
    ",where the summation is over all $N_P$ points in the rotation curve and $V_{mod,j}$ and $V_{obs,j}$ are the\n",
    "model and observed rotation velocities in point j respectively. $V_{r,j}$ are the individual errorbars\n",
    "on the observed rotation curve points and $V_{i,j}$ are the errors in the rotation velocities\n",
    "due to inclination uncertainties (see section 4.3.4 for details); for the fits presented in this\n",
    "chapter, we simply added the two contributions to the errors quadratically.\"\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\"For all models, we also list in the tables in appendix 6-II a chi-squared parameter $\\chi_{2}^{2}$, which was calculated by considering the individual errorbars only and __neglecting the inclination uncertainties__ (i.e. setting $V_{i,j}$ = 0 in equation 6.9), as well as the two corresponding reduced chi-squared quantities $\\chi_{i,r}^{2}$ = $\\chi_{i}^{2}/(N_{p}-N_{dof})$, with $N_{dof}$ the number of degrees of freedom in the fits. It is important to note here that the errors on our rotation curves are neither Gaussian nor independent. The absolute values of the chi-squared quantities are therefore not statistically meaningful; for several rotation curves in particular, the large inclination uncertainties $V_{i,j}$, which are not independent for individual points in the rotation curves, lead to\n",
    "$\\chi_{1}^{2}$ << 1.0. However, the chi-squared values are still useful to distinguish between the different\n",
    "models for each galaxy and help to determine how much the quality of the fits degrades\n",

A similar procedure is followed with the HI density distribution. To account for the presence of primordial Helium, the HI surface densities are multiplied by 1.43” (pg 4).
