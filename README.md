# Gravitation Project

The purpose of this project is to reproduce rotation curves of galaxies.
Currently, this includes the rotation curve components of NGC5533 from Noordermeer 2007.

This repository hosts all code we have made to this end as well as some notes, both primarily in the form of jupyter notebooks.

## Directories

`./` - Miscellaneous; old notebooks and files for automated testing.

`documents` - Contains write-ups we have done on the subject.

`fitting` - All code pertaining to the actual fitting of the curves.

`latex` - Some equations rendered in LaTeX.

`ngc 5533 total` - An unfitted total curve done without the use of our own libraries, and other notebooks created to help us reach this point. This includes the code and saved outputs.

`NGC5533_BlackHole` - An unfitted contribution to the rotation curve due only to the black hole. This includes the notebook and saved output.

`NGC5533_Bulge` - An unfitted contribution to the rotation curve due only to the central bulge. This includes multiple notebooks and saved outputs.

`NGC5533_Disk` - An unfitted contribution to the rotation curve due only to the stellar disk. This includes multiple notebooks and saved outputs.

`NGC5533_Gas` - An unfitted contribution to the rotation curve due only to HI gas. This includes the notebook and saved output.

`NGC5533_Halo` - An unfitted contribution to the rotation curve due only to the dark matter halo. This includes the notebook and saved outputs.

`NGC5533_Static_Final` - Most recent unfitted versions of the total, black hole, bulge, disk, and halo curves for NGC5533.

`notes` - Notes on the project, organized by writer.

`python` - Custom libraries used.

`Rotation_Velocities` - Rotation curve data and notebook for multiple galaxies.

`scripts` - Miscellaneous python scripts for performing tedious operations.

`testing` - Area for any manual testing for ideas, libraries, methods, etc.
