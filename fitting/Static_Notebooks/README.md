# Static Notebooks

The purpose of this directory is to have a record of when the last time a combination of fitting parameters worked and how long it took.
Therefore, each notebook should have a timestamp as well as a duration listed.

Notebooks with long runtimes can be re-run.  This will cause them to save data to the hdf5 files, which should reduce the required time for similar fits in the future.

I am currently working on adding each of these to the automated testing once I have brought their run times low enough to do so.
